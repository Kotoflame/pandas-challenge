Written report:

Below is a series of calculations and summaries of data collected over the school district and student population.
 Within the district there are 15 schools and 39,170 students. Student test results show passing rates for math, reading, and the overall (combined)
 passing rates. In general, reading results show more passing students. Of the top 5 schools for overall passing rates, all 5 are charter schools. 
 Of the bottom 5, all are district schools. There appears to be an inverse relationship between per student spending and average passing rate. 
 The average budget per student is related to both the total school population. School populations between 1 and 2000 students didn't show 
 statistically different passing rates, but school larger than 2000 students showed a decline in average scores. The largest variance can be 
 seen when comparing district schools to charter schools. Charter schools show dramatically higher passing rates. This can explain the 
 population relationship and only one charter school falls over 2000 students whereas all schools under 2000 students were charter schools. 
 Charter schools also on average have less total funding per student, thus explaining the inverse relationship between passing rates and per 
 student budget.
